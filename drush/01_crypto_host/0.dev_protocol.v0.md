# Prompt 1:
Generate techical implementation of this idea with ui and components for Nextjs in separate folder `cbl_app`

To implement the idea of CryptoBankLink as a Next.js application, we will create a folder named cbl_app and structure it with the necessary components and pages. Below is a simplified outline of the technical implementation, including the main components and pages.

## Folder Structure

```
cbl_app/
├── components/
│   ├── Header.js
│   ├── Footer.js
│   ├── TransactionForm.js
│   ├── CurrencyConverter.js
│   └── Dashboard.js
├── pages/
│   ├── index.js            # This is the main landing page for the application.
│   ├── transactions.js     # A form for handling transactions.
│   └── about.js            # Information about the product.
├── styles/
│   ├── globals.css
│   └── Home.module.css
└── package.json            # This file will include the necessary dependencies for a Next.js application.

```

## Explanation

- The cbl_app folder contains all the necessary components and pages for the CryptoBankLink application.
- Components are modularized for better maintainability and reusability.
- The application is structured to allow easy navigation between the home, transactions, and about pages.

You can now create the cbl_app folder and add these files to start building your Next.js application for CryptoBankLink.

# Prompt 2:

> Generate `Home.module.css` and explain the styles be applied to home page `index.js`

Here is the Home.module.css file for styling the home page (index.js) of the CryptoBankLink application, along with an explanation of the styles applied.

```css
...
```

Explanation of Styles Applied to index.js
1. Container:
The .container class is used to wrap the main content of the home page. It sets a maximum width of 1200px, centers the content with margin: 0 auto, and adds padding for spacing. The background color is a light gray (#f9f9f9), with rounded corners and a subtle box shadow for a card-like effect.
2. Header:
The .header class centers the header text and adds a margin below it to separate it from the rest of the content.
3. Title:
The .title class styles the main title of the home page, increasing the font size to 2.5rem for prominence and setting the text color to a dark gray (#333).
4. Dashboard:
The .dashboard class is used to style the dashboard section, aligning its items in a column and centering them. This ensures that the components within the dashboard (like TransactionForm and CurrencyConverter) are neatly stacked and centered.
5. Footer:
The .footer class styles the footer text, adding a margin at the top for spacing and centering the text. The font size is slightly smaller (0.9rem) and the color is a lighter gray (#666) to differentiate it from the main content.

Usage in index.js
To apply these styles in your index.js, you would import the CSS module and use the classes as follows:

```
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css';

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <div className={styles.container}>
            <Header className={styles.header} />
            <h1 className={styles.title}>Welcome to CryptoBankLink</h1>
            <div className={styles.dashboard}>
                <Dashboard />
            </div>
            <Footer className={styles.footer} />
        </div>
    );
}
```
This will ensure that the home page is styled according to the defined CSS module, providing a clean and modern look for the CryptoBankLink application.
